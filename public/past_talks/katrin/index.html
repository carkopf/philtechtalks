As the adoption of AI tools by researchers is increasing, opinions on the appropriate use of generative AI remain divided (see, for example, Kwon 2025). Additionally, a survey by Wiley found that nearly two-thirds of respondents indicated that the lack of guidelines prevents them from using generative AI to the extent that they would like (Wiley 2025). Thus, since 2023 research institutions and other stakeholders, like research funders and publishers, have been discussing how the use of generative AI in research should be dealt with from the perspective of research integrity. While a consensus on some matters was quickly reached, other issues are still being debated, particularly due to the ongoing technical advancements in the field of AI. As a result, an increasingly heterogeneous policy landscape is emerging, which still has some blind spots. Comparing existing AI policies and guidelines from various stakeholders, my talk will give an overview of current trends and challenges in the fields of research integrity and AI. It will be complemented by three short commentaries on key concepts of research integrity that have especially been in focus in recent debates.\nDr Katrin Frisch has been working as a researcher at the Ombuds Committee for Research Integrity in Germany since May 2020, specifically at the project “Discussion Hubs to Foster Research Integrity”, with a focus on research data and, since 2023, artificial intelligence. Between March 2023 and March 2024, she also worked as a research integrity advisor at the OWID office. The aim of the Discussion Hubs project is to create practical guidelines supplementary to the DFG Code of Conduct “Guidelines for Safeguarding Good Research Practice” as well as producing novel research on research integrity. Recent publications include the FAQ Artificial Intelligence and Research Integrity (version 2), a study on authorship and data use conflicts as well as a monograph on fairness in science (both only available in German). You can find an overview of the project and related output here.\nAbout Katrin Dr. Katrin Frisch is Head of AI Policy at the German Ombuds Office for Research Integrity. She coordinates national initiatives on research data and artificial intelligence in relation to good scientific practice and has published widely on authorship, data usage, and the ethical challenges of AI in research.\n","wordCount":"410","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-12-05T10:00:10+01:00","dateModified":"2025-12-05T10:00:10+01:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://philtechtalks.netlify.app/past_talks/katrin/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Phil.Tech.Talks","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://philtechtalks.netlify.app/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://philtechtalks.netlify.app/ accesskey=h title="Phil.Tech.Talks (Alt + H)">Phil.Tech.Talks</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://philtechtalks.netlify.app/past_talks/ title="Past talks"><span>Past talks</span></a></li><li><a href=https://philtechtalks.netlify.app/workshop/ title=Workshop><span>Workshop</span></a></li><li><a href=https://philtechtalks.netlify.app/contact/ title="Join in"><span>Join in</span></a></li><li><a href=https://philtechtalks.netlify.app/search/ title="🔍 (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>🔍</span></a></li></ul><div class=juelich-logo><a href=https://www.fz-juelich.de/en target=_blank title="Forschungszentrum Jülich"><img src=/juelich-logo.svg alt="Forschungszentrum Jülich" height=140></a></div></nav></header><style>.juelich-logo{display:flex;align-items:center;margin-left:auto;padding-left:20px}.juelich-logo img{height:140px;width:auto;opacity:.85;transition:opacity .2s,transform .2s ease}.juelich-logo img:hover{opacity:1;transform:scale(1.05)}@media screen and (max-width:768px){.juelich-logo{display:none}}</style><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">December 5: Dr. Katrin Frisch (German Ombuds Board for Scientific Integrity)</h1></header><div class=post-content><h4 id=title>Title<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#title>#</a></h4><p>Research Integrity in the Age of generative AI: Trends and Challenges</p><h4 id=abstract>Abstract<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#abstract>#</a></h4><p>Since the launch of ChatGPT in autumn 2022, generative AI has become one of the dominating topics in academic and research integrity.
