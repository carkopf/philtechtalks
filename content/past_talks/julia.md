#### Title
 The human behind human-centered AI

#### Abstract
In philosophy and other disciplines, the question what distinguishes humans from animals has been debated for centuries. However, current technological advancements in the field of artificial intelligence raise concerns about the distinction between humans and machines. What is therefore meant if legislators or AI ethicists claim that the development and deployment of AI systems are supposed to be human-centered? Is this human-centricity actually (just) a synonym for value-centered design? And can this "humanness" be translated into code, standards or norms?
