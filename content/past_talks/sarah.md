#### Title
The ethics of cerebral organoid research: Searching for markers of consciousness  

#### Abstract
Will (some) cerebral organoids acquire the capacity to develop consciousness, and if so what kind? In light of the advances of the technology concerns have been raised that over time these structures may develop mental capacities worthy of protection. This has spurred attempts to identify markers that warrant caution. But what markers should that be and can a marker-based approach account for the forms of consciousness cerebral organoids might develop? I argue that such deliberations benefit from a stronger focus on current laboratory practices that generate organoids as models for brain research.
