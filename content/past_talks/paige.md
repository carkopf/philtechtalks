#### Title
AI technology as hostile epistemology:
A threat to democratic legitimacy

#### Abstract
C. Thi Nguyen developed the notion ‘Hostile Epistemology’ (2021, 2023) and defined it as “the
study of how environmental features (such as people, communities, cultural practices,
institutional structures and technologies) can exploit our cognitive vulnerabilities and
weaknesses” (Nguyen 2023, 1). In this talk, I argue that political agents in liberal constitutional
democracies should regard AI technology as an epistemically hostile environment. Not only does
AI technology (generative and predictive AI) undermine clarity and trust, necessary conditions of
a healthy epistemic, but it also enhances the seductiveness of belief systems. For example, AI-
driven engagement optimisation algorithms, deepfakes, and automated bots, among other
elements, amplify a hostile epistemic environment where emotionally charged content, false
credentials, and manipulative narratives thrive. The implication of AI as a hostile epistemic
network is that it intensifies the erosion of both institutional trust and civic trust, which
undermines the democratic legitimacy of a constitutional democracy. I end the talk by discussing
potential avenues for mitigation.
