#### Title
Total deontic folk relationalism

**Note: This colloquium took place at 14:00 instead of the usual 10:00.**

#### Abstract
Total deontic folk relationalism (TDFR) is a new family of comprehensive moral theories. It represents an alternative to the standard theoretical traditions in modern moral philosophy, such as utilitarianism, contractualism, and care ethics. In this presentation, I will introduce TDFR and will describe some of its main advantages and disadvantages.
