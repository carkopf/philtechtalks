#### Title
The Conversion Hypothesis: A Physical Approach to Qualia

#### Abstract
Through the advent of modern neurotechnology like brain-computer interfaces (abbr. BCIs) the data-based analysis of brain activity reaches new levels of precision, data fidelity, and accuracy both in brain imaging and scanning contexts.  While these technological advances allow us to obtain ever-increasing volumes of data from the brain, the issue of interpreting this data remains. Correlation doesn´t equal causation; hence any observed brain activity might merely correlate temporarily with the subject´s experience of qualia instead of causing the very experience of qualia. Thus, the mysteries of qualia remain, and the incomprehensibly complex question of human experience continues: How – if at all – can our consciousness be explained? Possibly even more intriguing: Will the subjectivity of the first-person perspective eventually become accessible through technology, hence objectifying the subjective? Or is the sphere of qualia sealed and inherently protected from any kind of outward analysis?
