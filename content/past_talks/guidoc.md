#### Title
A philosophical foundation for the right to personal identity

#### Abstract
In this article, I present a philosophical foundation and characterization of the right to personal identity (RPI). First, I criticize the dominant formulations of the right to personal identity proposed to address new challenges brought about by neurotechnologies (Ienca and Andorno 2017; Yuste et al 2017; Yuste et al. 2021; Ienca 2021). I criticize these formulations for being too narrow and not encompassing enough, failing to capture and protect relevant dimensions of identity and self. Then, I propose a multidimensional framework of identity and the self (Gallagher 2013; Newen 2018) and clarify the conditions for self-extension. This will allow me to present a multidimensional, multi-layered and extended characterization of the right to personal identity, as a special instance of the right to mental integrity (Cassinadri 2025).
