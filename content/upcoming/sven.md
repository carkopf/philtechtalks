#### Title
Russell and Floridi on Artificial Intelligence and Agency

#### Abstract

Are (some) AI technologies agents and if so, in what sense(s)? And why
consider this topic? One interesting similarity between Stuart Russell's
discussion of AI in his book Human Compatible (2019) and Luciano
Floridi's discussion of AI in his book Ethics of Artificial Intelligence
(2023) is that both of them define artificial intelligence in terms of
agency. In my presentation, I will first motivate why it is interesting
to reflect on whether at least some AI technologies are agents and then
compare and contrast the agency-based definitions of AI in the Russell
and Floridi's respective books. I will argue that their views can be
combined in interesting ways but that it is best to define AI in a way
that leaves it open whether AI technologies are agents in any
significant sense.
