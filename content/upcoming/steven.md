### Title
Putting Health First: an Ethical Argument for Prioritizing Medical AI Over Other Technological Developments 
 
### Abstract
This chapter develops an ethical argument that supports the thesis that the development of Medical Artificial Intelligence (MAI) should be prioritized over other applications of Artificial Intelligence: unlike applications focused on convenience, consumer preferences, or financial efficiency, MAI focuses in urgent global health challenges by offering scalable solutions that can reduce suffering, save lives, and mitigate healthcare inequalities. Based in the moral reasoning of Effective Altruism, the chapter argues that directing resources toward MAI development is not only justified but morally imperative, given its potential for high-impact outcomes in both developed and underserved regions. Through a comparative analysis, we show that while other AI sectors (such as autonomous vehicles, financial AI, and e-commerce) offer some societal benefits, but they lack the immediacy and global importance that healthcare technologies have. Finally, the chapter considers common objections to the prioritization thesis, such as the challenges of implementing MAI, being support by a problematic ethical framework (Effective Altruism), or concerns over resource misallocation. We argue that these critiques fail to challenge the fundamental ethical rationale: that MAI possesses an exceptional capacity to achieve a moral obligation, that is, to alleviate human suffering where it is both urgent and tractable. If we can primarily focus our limited resources in development and use of MAI, society we will be able to provide high-quality care to populations that have been historically marginalized or underserved and, at the same time, increasing the healthcare services of populations from developed countries.
