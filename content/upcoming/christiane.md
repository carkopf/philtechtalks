#### Title
Manipulation and Chatbots 

NB: This talk will be held in German

#### Abstract
In my talk, I develop the thesis that we should refrain from speaking about chatbots as if they are capable of manipulating us. Strictly speaking, only persons can manipulate other persons. A chatbot can help someone achieve a manipulative goal, but it is only in this derivative sense that chatbots can be said to manipulate. The proposed restriction on the way we talk about chatbots is important for two reasons. First: When we use the term "manipulation," we typically have ethically problematic behavior in view. But chatbots cannot be held morally responsible. The people who design and supply them can be held responsible, as perhaps can those who are in position to regulate them but fail to do so. Second, it is sensible to use concepts that are as clear as possible when describing AI and the problems it might create. Often, however, the concept of manipulation is used even though more appropriate descriptions are available to us that would contribute to a better understanding of the situation. Talk of manipulation may then fail to help us grasp the problem at hand precisely. Worse still, it may inflate the problem, or even obscure facts about responsibility.
