## Workshop Overview
Deep learning model architectures are increasingly powerful, and are being used in increasingly many arenas of human life. To use them responsibly, we have to know something about how they work, and to what extent they process information like humans do. But that knowledge is hard to come by. In this workshop, we will discuss both how that knowledge might be gained, and how to use such deep learning models responsibly, given what we currently know.
