#### Title
Inventorship and IP after Knowledge-Creating AI

#### Abstract
Can AI be an inventor? Recent judicial rulings rejecting artificial intelligence as an inventor, exemplified by the Swiss Federal Administrative Court's 2025 DABUS decision, reveal a conceptual tension where the requirement for intellectual creation by a natural person is formally maintained even as AI-assisted practice renders human contributions increasingly nominal. Applying the method of pragmatic genealogy, I reconstruct the historical "need matrices" that shaped the concept of inventor - from Venetian guild economics through Romantic genius ideology to corporate R&D – to evaluate its cognitive presuppositions and identify the practical needs it serves. On this basis, I argue that instead of extending inventorship to AI or preserving a hollowed-out requirement for human intellectual labour, we ought to alleviate the mismatch between the inherited concept of inventor and modern technological capacities by disaggregating the multiple functional roles we need the concept to discharge.
