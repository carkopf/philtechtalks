#### Title
What gives the Ethics of AI its Bad Name?

#### Abstract
I will consider what exactly the value of the ethics of AI is in the current AI regulatory context amidst different calls for keeping AI innovation ‘responsible’ and formulating some kind of international regulation of AI. I will make suggestions on how AI ethics contributes to upholding human rights law, standards, and principles; and also, on how to delineate, but at the same time connect it to AI safety conversations. I will conclude with suggestions on how to ensure AI ethics is an enabler of sound and trustworthy AI innovation.
