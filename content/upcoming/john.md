#### Title
Why Care Practices Should Prioritize Living Beings Over AI: Critique of “AI Welfare”

#### Abstract
 In this talk, I critique the growing “AI welfare” movement and propose the Precariousness Guideline to determine care entitlement. In contrast to approaches that emphasize potential for suffering, the  Precariousness  Guideline is grounded in objectively observable features. The severity of current planetwide biodiversity loss and climate change provide additional reasons to prioritize the needs of living beings.
