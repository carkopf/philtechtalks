#### Title
Reasoning dependency

#### Abstract
I present a chapter from my book project on the nature and normative status of manipulation. The overall aim of the book is to defend the indifference account of manipulation in detail, arguing that manipulation is a type of indifference to reveal reasons to the target. In my talk, I will present the first chapter of the book, which describes the background view of human decision making against which I will develop the new account of manipulation. Specifically, this chapter argues that human reasoning—encompassing both the recognition of normative reasons and the capacity to act upon them—is inherently dependent on our social and environmental contexts. Rather than being solely an individual deliberative process, being "attuned to reason" emerges from a network of interactions that shape our values, choices, and actions. By examining everyday decisions and exploring the roles of both reflective and non-reflective processes, the chapter reveals how our ability to reason effectively is fundamentally extended through social scaffolding and environmental support. This perspective not only highlights the significance of our dependency for sound judgment but also sets the stage for a rethinking of manipulation. In particular, it shows how manipulation can disrupt the very conditions necessary for being attuned to reasons – not only by active, nefarious commission – as currently thought – but also through ‘mere indifference,’ which, I argue, is way more pernicious than currently recognized.
 

#### About [Michael](https://www.michael-klenk.com)

Michael is Assistant Professor of Practical Philosophy at Delft University of Technology, where he explores pressing ethical questions in technology and society. His research spans metaethics, normative ethics, applied ethics, and the philosophy of technology, with a current focus on the ethics of influence and manipulation. Starting September 2025, he will lead an ERC-funded project on the nature and normative status of manipulation in the context of AI. He also leads several ongoing projects examining the ethics of manipulation and its implications for technological developments like advanced AI assistants, collaborating with engineers and policymakers to translate ethical insights into actionable frameworks for responsible research and innovation.
