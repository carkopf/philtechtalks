#### Title
Automation and meaningful work

#### Abstract
In this talk, I argue that meaning in life has a more substantive subjective element than is commonly thought. This claim, if correct, has significant implications for debates on meaningful work. I argue that the meaningfulness of work can come apart from the extent to which workers obtain achievements at work. In doing so, I respond to Danaher and Nyholm’s (2021) recent argument that automation threatens meaningful work by leading to ‘achievement gaps’. Pace Danaher and Nyholm, I argue that even if automation threatens achievement, it does not necessarily follow that it threatens meaningful work.
