Silvia is Senior Lecturer in Philosophy in the SPA Department and Egenis centre at the University of Exeter, and a Humboldt Fellow at the LMU Munich, based at the Munich Centre for Mathematical Philosophy. 
Previously, she was a Research Fellow at the Future of Humanity Institute (FHI) in the Faculty of Philosophy, University of Oxford and William Golding Junior Research Fellow at Brasenose College. Before that, she was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute, where she remains affiliated with the Governance of Emerging Technologies (GET) research programme.

Her interests lie primarily in epistemology, ethics, and intersections between the two, especially in connection with Artificial Intelligence. Her current research investigates epistemological and ethical issues relating to recommender systems.
